### ***Gene Expression Score Predictor***

Use this module to **query specific gene(s) and generate graphs for publications.**

By default, for scATAC-seq datasets, PlaqView uses ArchR's default method, MAGIC, to predict gene scores based on nearby open regions. Details for this calculation can be found on [this page](https://www.archrproject.com/bookdown/marker-genes-imputation-with-magic.html).
